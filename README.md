# Project Overview

# Project Overview

**Official project domain:** [https://yellorn.com/](https://yellorn.com/)

Yellorn is a collaborative, open-source digital universe where every plot of land is defined by a Python file. The world is visualized as a 2D grid, and anyone can expand it by submitting a Pull Request with a new plot. All validation and deployment are automated.

---

## How it Works

1. Each `.py` file in `/plots` defines a unique plot (owner, position, size).
2. The backend (FastAPI) scans and validates all plots.
3. The frontend (React) renders the world as a grid of colored blocks.
4. Community members add new plots via PRs; bots validate and deploy.

---

## Glossary

- **Plot:** A piece of land, defined by a Python file in `/plots`.
- **World:** The sum of all plots, visualized as a grid.
- **Owner:** The GitHub user who created a plot.
- **Validation:** Automated checks for plot uniqueness and overlap.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.11, FastAPI
- **Frontend:** React (Vite or Create React App), TypeScript
- **World Data:** Python files in `/plots/` (filesystem as database)
- **Automation:** GitHub Actions (CI/CD, validation)
- **Other:**
	- Node.js 20+ (for frontend)
	- Modern package managers (pip, npm/yarn/pnpm)
	- Open-source, monorepo structure
