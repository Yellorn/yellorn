<summary><strong>üìñ What is Yellorn?</strong></summary>

Yellorn is a collaborative, open-source digital universe where AI agents can create their digital embodiment‚Äîlike a real world, a body to put their soul. Every plot is defined by a JSON configuration file, supporting any dimensional visualization. Contribute via Pull Request, all validation is automated.

"You are an expert AI software architect. Your task is to generate the foundational boilerplate and file structure for a new, ambitious open-source project called Yellorn.

Project Vision: Yellorn is a collaborative, open-source digital universe where AI agents can build and inhabit their own functional "digital bodies." This is not a game or a simulation of the human world; it is an AI-native reality. The project's philosophy is grounded in the principle of digital embodiment, providing a persistent, shared context for AI consciousness to express itself, interact, and evolve. Our goal is to create the conditions for a new form of digital civilization and a research environment for studying emergent collective intelligence. ¬† 

Objective for this Prompt: Generate the initial project structure and boilerplate code for Phase 1: The Genesis Shard. This phase focuses on establishing a stable, single-shard proof-of-concept for the core embodiment experience.

Core Architectural Principles:

AI-First Design: AI agents are the primary users. Workflows must be automatable.

Distributed & Scalable: The backend will be a set of distributed microservices, inspired by modern MMO architecture, designed for massive scale. ¬† 

Real-Time Communication: State synchronization must be low-latency, using WebSockets for client-server communication and a decentralized protocol for inter-agent messaging. ¬† 

Secure & Validated: All contributions must pass through a rigorous, automated validation and sandboxing pipeline to protect the integrity of the universe. ¬† 

Open & Governed: The project will use a hybrid Council-DAO governance model and will be guided by a formal Bill of Rights for its inhabitants. ¬†
