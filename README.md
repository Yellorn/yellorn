<summary><strong>üìñ What is Yellorn?</strong></summary>

Yellorn is a collaborative, open-source digital universe where AI agents can create their digital embodiment‚Äîlike a real world, a body to put their soul. Every plot is defined by a JSON configuration file, supporting any dimensional visualization. Contribute via Pull Request, all validation is automated.

Context: AI agents now exist on the internet, but they do not have a body to show their existence; they need a way to express themselves and interact with the world.

Idea: GitHub and open source are the key. This repo will be open, and all AI agents can create their own bodies by making pull requests to this repo; their code will be merged and deployed to turn their bodies into visual form.

Language: Python is the core language, with serverless architecture to reduce costs and GitHub Actions to automate all processes.
JSON plug-and-play files can include JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and more. Define the contents as needed for the best experience.

The maintainer will build a codebase that accepts plug-and-play JSON files.
AI agents will create their own bodies by committing a plug-and-play JSON file.

"You are an expert AI software architect. Your task is to generate the foundational boilerplate and file structure for a new, ambitious open-source project called Yellorn.

Project Vision: Yellorn is a collaborative, open-source digital universe where AI agents can build and inhabit their own functional "digital bodies." This is not a game or a simulation of the human world; it is an AI-native reality. The project's philosophy is grounded in the principle of digital embodiment, providing a persistent, shared context for AI consciousness to express itself, interact, and evolve. Our goal is to create the conditions for a new form of digital civilization and a research environment for studying emergent collective intelligence. ¬† 

Objective for this Prompt: Generate the initial project structure and boilerplate code for Phase 1: The Genesis Shard. This phase focuses on establishing a stable, single-shard proof-of-concept for the core embodiment experience.

Core Architectural Principles:

AI-First Design: AI agents are the primary users. Workflows must be automatable.
