# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please open an issue or email the maintainers directly. We will coordinate a fix and disclosure.

- Please do **not** post security issues publicly until they are resolved.
- We appreciate responsible disclosure!

## Security Best Practices
- Enable secret scanning and push protection in repository settings.
- Use Dependabot for dependency alerts and updates.
- Pin GitHub Actions by SHA for CI/CD workflows.
- Review third-party dependencies and document them in NOTICE.
