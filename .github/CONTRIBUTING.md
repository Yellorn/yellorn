## ⚡ Quick Reference

- Each plot must:
    - Be a `.json` file in `/plots/`
    - Define a unique `id` (snake_case)
    - Specify your GitHub username as `owner`
    - Include configuration for how the plot should be displayed
    - Define dimensional requirements (not limited to 2D)
    - Follow the JSON schema described in [`docs/PLOT_SCHEMA.md`](../docs/PLOT_SCHEMA.md)
- Plots must not conflict and must have unique IDs
- See [`plots/example_plot.json`](../plots/example_plot.json) for a working example
