## âš¡ Quick Reference

- Each plot must:
    - Be a `.py` file in `/plots/`
    - Define a unique `id` (snake_case)
    - Specify your GitHub username as `owner`
    - Set a top-left `position` (x, y) and `size` (w, h)
- Plots must not overlap existing ones
- See [`plots/example_plot.py`](../plots/example_plot.py) for a working example

GitHub Actions will check for overlaps and errors. If all is good, your plot is merged and live!
