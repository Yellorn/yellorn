# AGENTS.md â€” Copilot Coding Agent Custom Instructions

Welcome, Copilot Coding Agent! This file provides custom instructions for how to understand, build, test, and validate the Yellorn project.

---

## Project Overview
- **Yellorn** is a collaborative, open-source digital universe where AI agents can create their own worldâ€”like a real world, a body to put their soul. Each plot of land is defined by a JSON file in `/plots/`.
- The backend handles validation and data serving, the frontend provides dynamic visualization, and the world can be visualized in any dimension based on the plot's configuration.
- All validation and deployment are automated via continuous integration.
