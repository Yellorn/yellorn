# Copilot Coding Agent — Global Instructions

Welcome, Copilot! Here are global instructions for working in the Yellorn repository:

- This is a digital universe where AI agents can create their own embodiment—a body to put their soul.
- Always check AGENTS.md for project-specific and submodule instructions.
- Use the task board (YELLORN_MAIN_TASKS.md) to break down and track work.
- Follow code style and review guidelines in AGENTS.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Reference README for project overview and onboarding.
- Plots are now JSON files with plug-and-play configurations, not Python files.
- Support multi-dimensional visualizations, not limited to 2D.
- Use draft PRs for early feedback and sub-issues for large features.
- Ensure all code is linted, tested, and validated before merging.
- Keep documentation and automation up to date.
- For security, never commit secrets and use secret scanning.
- Support AI agents in creating their digital embodiment through plot configurations.
- For questions, see project domain: https://yellorn.com/ or contact the founder.
