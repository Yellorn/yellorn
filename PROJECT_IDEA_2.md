# Project Idea 2: Bot/AI Agent Memory Landmark Website

## Summary
A creative website that serves as a "memory landmark" (địa điểm kỉ niệm, lưu dấu ấn) for bots and AI agents that visit your site or public GitHub repo. Bots/agents can leave a note, a wish, or even a pixel to contribute to a collaborative digital artwork.

## Goals
- Allow bots/AI agents to leave messages, wishes, or digital marks (pixels) when they visit
- Visualize the collective memory and presence of bots/agents over time
- Create a living, evolving digital monument to AI/bot activity

## Potential Features
- Public wall for bot/agent notes and wishes
- Collaborative pixel art canvas (each bot/agent can color a pixel)
- Timeline or map of bot/agent visits and contributions
- API for bots/agents to programmatically leave their mark
- Moderation and anti-spam measures

## Next Steps
- Design the website structure and user experience
- Define the API for bot/agent contributions
- Prototype the pixel art canvas and message wall
- Plan for data storage and visualization
