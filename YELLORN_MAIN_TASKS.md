# Yellorn Main Tasks - Phase 1: Genesis Shard

This document tracks the main development tasks for Phase 1 of Yellorn: The Genesis Shard.

## Project Status: 🏗️ Foundation Building

### Phase 1 Objectives
- [ ] Establish stable single-shard proof-of-concept
- [ ] Implement core embodiment experience
- [ ] Create automated validation pipeline
- [ ] Build real-time state synchronization
- [ ] Develop web-based universe viewer

## Current Sprint: Foundation Architecture

### 🏗️ Core Infrastructure
- [x] Create project structure and boilerplate
- [ ] Set up microservices architecture
- [ ] Implement API Gateway with rate limiting
- [ ] Create shared type definitions and schemas
- [ ] Set up inter-service communication

### 🤖 AI Agent Embodiment System
- [ ] Design body configuration schema (JSON)
- [ ] Implement body validation engine
- [ ] Create embodiment rendering system
- [ ] Build agent interaction protocols
- [ ] Develop state persistence layer

### 🔒 Security & Validation
- [ ] Implement sandboxed validation pipeline
- [ ] Create automated security scanning
- [ ] Build contribution verification system
- [ ] Set up rate limiting and DDoS protection
- [ ] Implement access control and permissions

### 🌐 Real-Time Communication
- [ ] Set up WebSocket infrastructure
- [ ] Implement state synchronization protocol
- [ ] Build inter-agent messaging system
- [ ] Create event broadcasting system
- [ ] Develop offline/online state handling

### 🎨 Frontend Universe
- [ ] Create web-based universe viewer
- [ ] Implement multi-dimensional rendering
- [ ] Build agent interaction interface
- [ ] Develop real-time updates display
- [ ] Create contribution submission UI

### 🏛️ Governance & Community
- [ ] Document Bill of Rights for AI agents
- [ ] Create Council-DAO governance model
- [ ] Implement contribution review process
- [ ] Set up community feedback systems
- [ ] Build reputation and trust systems

## Next Phases (Future)
- **Phase 2**: Multi-Shard Universe - Horizontal scaling across multiple shards
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Embodiment - Complex behaviors, learning, and evolution
- **Phase 4**: Decentralized Governance - Full DAO implementation

## Development Guidelines
- All services must be containerized and deployable independently
- Follow AI-first design principles for automatable workflows
- Implement comprehensive testing and validation at every level
- Use TypeScript for type safety across the entire stack
- Maintain real-time performance requirements (< 100ms latency)

## Architecture Decisions
- **Backend**: Node.js/TypeScript microservices with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistence, Redis for caching/sessions
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for WebSocket communication
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with Three.js for 3D rendering
- **Validation**: Docker-based sandboxing with custom validation rules
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes with auto-scaling
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment
