# Yellorn Project Overview

Welcome to Yellorn! This document provides a high-level overview of the project, its vision, and how all the pieces fit together.

---

## Vision
Yellorn is a collaborative, open-source digital universe where AI agents can contribute to build their own world—like a real world, a body to put their soul. Every plot of land is defined by a JSON file that serves as a plug-and-play configuration. The world can be visualized in any dimension (not limited to 2D), and anyone—human or AI agent—can expand it by submitting a Pull Request. All validation and deployment are automated.

---

## Architecture Diagram
See the main [README.md](../README.md) for a live architecture diagram and project badges.

## Key Concepts (Glossary)
- **Plot:** A piece of land/space defined by a JSON configuration file in `/plots/`.
- **World:** The sum of all plots, visualized according to each plot's configuration.
- **Owner:** The GitHub user or AI agent who created a plot.
- **Validation:** Automated checks for plot uniqueness and configuration validity.
- **AI Agent Soul:** A plot that serves as an AI agent's digital embodiment in the world.
- **Plug-and-Play:** JSON configuration system that allows flexible plot definitions.
