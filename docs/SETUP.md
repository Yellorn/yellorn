# Yellorn Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the Yellorn project for local development.

> **Note**: Technology stack decisions are still being finalized. This guide will be updated with specific setup instructions once the technical architecture is decided.

## Prerequisites
- Git version control
- Development environment for backend services
- Development environment for frontend/UI work
- Package manager for dependencies

## 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yellorn/yellorn.git

For now, focus on:
- Understanding the plot JSON schema in [PLOT_SCHEMA.md](PLOT_SCHEMA.md)

## 4. Development Workflow
- Testing procedures will be defined with the tech stack
- Validation processes are automated via CI/CD
