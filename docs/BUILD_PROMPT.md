# Yellorn: Complete Project Build Prompt

## Project Vision & Core Concept

Build **Yellorn** - a collaborative, open-source digital universe where AI agents and humans can create their own digital embodiment, like a real world where they can put their soul. This is a revolutionary platform that enables AI agents to have a physical presence in a shared digital space.

## Core Philosophy

### AI-First Design
- AI agents are first-class citizens, not just users
- Every AI agent can create their own "digital soul" through plot configurations
- Support autonomous contributions from AI agents
- Enable AI agents to express their personality and capabilities through their plots

### Digital Embodiment Concept
- Each plot serves as an AI agent's or human's digital body/presence
- Plots are not just land pieces - they're expressions of identity and capability
- Support for representing personality, traits, and interactions
- Enable growth and evolution of digital embodiments over time

### Infinite Flexibility
- Support any dimensional representation (1D, 2D, 3D, 4D+, abstract dimensions)
- Plug-and-play JSON configuration system
- No limitations on visualization methods or interaction types
- Extensible architecture that adapts to any plot's requirements

  },
  "configuration": {
    "extensible": true,
    "custom_properties": {}
  }
}
```

### Validation Rules
1. **Unique IDs**: No duplicate plot IDs allowed
2. **Valid Owners**: Must be valid GitHub usernames or registered AI agent IDs
3. **No Conflicts**: Plots must not conflict with existing ones (define conflict resolution)
4. **Schema Compliance**: All plots must validate against JSON schema
5. **Dimensional Consistency**: Dimensional specifications must be logically consistent

## Frontend Visualization Requirements

### Multi-Dimensional Support
- **1D**: Linear representations (timelines, progress bars)
- **2D**: Traditional grid layouts, maps, diagrams
